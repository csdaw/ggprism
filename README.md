The `ggprism` package provides various themes, palettes, and other
useful functions to customise ggplots and give them the *‘GraphPad
Prism’* look.

## Install

Install the latest version from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("ggprism")
```

Install the development version from GitHub:

``` r
remotes::install_github("csdaw/ggprism")
```

## How to Use

See the [Getting
Started](https://csdaw.github.io/ggprism/articles/ggprism.html) page for
a quick overview of `ggprism` features. Detailed examples and
instructions can be found below and on the [`ggprism`
website](https://csdaw.github.io/ggprism/).

``` r
library(ggplot2)
library(ggprism)

tg <- ToothGrowth
tg$dose <- as.factor(tg$dose)

base <- ggplot(tg, aes(x = dose, y = len)) + 
  geom_violin(aes(colour = dose, fill = dose), trim = FALSE) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = dose), width = 0.2, colour = "black") + 
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-5, 40))

p_vals <- tibble::tribble(
  ~group1, ~group2, ~p.adj,   ~y.position,
  "0.5",   "1",     8.80e-14, 35,
  "0.5",   "2",     1.27e-7,  39
)
```

``` r
base

base + 
  scale_color_prism("floral") + 
  scale_fill_prism("floral") + 
  guides(y = "prism_offset_minor") + 
  theme_prism(base_size = 16) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  add_pvalue(p_vals, label = "p = {p.adj}", tip.length = 0, label.size = 4)
```
