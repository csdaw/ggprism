Description: Provides various themes, palettes, and other functions
    that are used to customise ggplots to look like they were made in 'GraphPad 
    Prism'. The 'Prism'-look is achieved with theme_prism() and 
    scale_fill|colour_prism(), axes can be changed with custom guides like 
    guide_prism_minor(), and significance indicators added with add_pvalue().
