In this vignette we will recreate a graph which was used in the advertising 
material for GraphPad Prism 8. The graph shows the 'response' of e.g. a 
cell surface receptor when you add increasing concentrations of an agonist
molecule in the presence or not of a competitive inhibitor. The underlying data 
set comes from one of the XY dose response tutorials included with Prism.

## Preparation

First, we load the necessary packages.

```{r}
# for the graph
library(ggplot2)
library(ggprism)
library(ggnewscale)

# just for manipulating the data.frame
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
```

Then we prepare the data.

```{r}
# construct the data.frame, log10 transform the agonist concentration
# convert the data.frame to long format, then remove any rows with NA
df <- data.frame(
  agonist = c(1e-10, 1e-8, 3e-8, 1e-7, 3e-7, 1e-6, 3e-6, 1e-5, 3e-5, 1e-4, 3e-4),
  ctr1 = c(0, 11, 125, 190, 258, 322, 354, 348, NA, 412, NA),
  ctr2 = c(3, 33, 141, 218, 289, 353, 359, 298, NA, 378, NA),
  ctr3 = c(2, 25, 160, 196, 345, 328, 369, 372, NA, 399, NA),
  trt1 = c(3, NA, 11, 52, 80, 171, 289, 272, 359, 352, 389),
  trt2 = c(5, NA, 25, 55, 77, 195, 230, 333, 306, 320, 338), 
  trt3 = c(4, NA, 28, 61, 44, 246, 243, 310, 297, 365, NA)
) %>% 
  mutate(log.agonist = log10(agonist)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    c(-agonist, -log.agonist), 
    names_pattern = "(.{3})([0-9])", 
    names_to = c("treatment", "rep"),
    values_to = "response"
  ) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(response))

head(df)
```

## Adjusting data-related elements

Now we begin constructing the plot, layer-by-layer. The order of each step
below is important and if you mix them around the final plot will not appear
as it should.

First, we'll just give the `ggplot()` function our data.

```{r}
# plot the log10(agonist concentration) vs the response
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x = log.agonist, y = response))
```

![](https://cdn.graphpad.com/assets/0.27.0/images/srcset/prism-get-actionable-help-w1920-800.png){ width=70% }

Looking at the original
plot we can see that the dose response curves underlie the data points, so 
we'll start by fitting these curves using `geom_smooth()`.

We need to define a formula for `geom_smooth()` to use. Here we will define a
four-parameter log-logistic model manually. See 
[this notebook](https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/378543_5b5bda32bf0541a485ccc49efbea680a.html) 
for more info on dose response curves in R.

```{r}
# define model (note x and ec50 are swapped around because ec50 is already -ve)
dose_resp <- y ~ min + ((max - min) / (1 + exp(hill_coefficient * (ec50 - x))))
```

```{r}
# fit separate curves to the data from the two treatment types
p <- p + geom_smooth(
  aes(colour = treatment),
  method = "nls", formula = dose_resp, se = FALSE,
  method.args = list(start = list(min = 1.67, max = 397, ec50 = -7, hill_coefficient = 1))
)
p
```

The colours of the curves in the original plot are not in any colour scheme
available in Prism. Therefore we will just colour them manually. While we're
at it we can give the two treatment groups more informative names in the legend
and move the legend inside the plot.

```{r}
# apply a manual colour scale to the curves
p <- p + scale_colour_manual(
  labels = c("No inhibitor", "Inhibitor"),
  values = c("#00167B", "#9FA3FE")
) +
  guides(
    colour = guide_legend(position = "inside"),
    shape = guide_legend(position = "inside")     
  ) + 
  theme(
    legend.position.inside = c(0.05, 0.95),
    legend.justification = c(0.05, 0.95)
  )
p
```

Now we can plot the actual data using `geom_point`. We'll change the point 
shape and colour depending on the treatment type. To use a separate colour
scale for the points versus the curves we can use the
`new_scale_colour()` function from 
[`ggnewscale`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggnewscale/index.html).
`new_scale_colour()` must be before `geom_point()` otherwise the new colour scales
will not work.

```{r}
# reset the colour scale, add the data points, then use a new colour scale
p <- p + ggnewscale::new_scale_colour() +
  geom_point(aes(colour = treatment, shape = treatment), size = 3) + 
  scale_colour_prism(
    palette = "winter_bright", 
    labels = c("No inhibitor",
               "Inhibitor")
  ) + 
  scale_shape_prism(
    labels = c("No inhibitor",
               "Inhibitor")
  )
p
```

## Adjusting theme elements

First, we'll apply `theme_prism`. The legend positioning is slightly buggy with
ggplot 3.5.0 and ggnewscale so we'll have to set it again.

```{r}
# use the Winter Bright theme and make the size of all plot elements larger
p <- p + theme_prism(palette = "winter_bright", base_size = 16) + 
  theme(
    legend.position.inside = c(0.05, 0.95),
    legend.justification = c(0.05, 0.95)
  )
p
```

Next we'll change the y axis limits and appearance. The `guide_prism_offset()` 
axis guide will shorten the axis line to the outer-most tick marks. This is 
similar to what is available in the 
["Frame and Origin"](https://www.graphpad.com/guides/prism/latest/user-guide/frame_and_axes.htm) 
tab in Prism.

```{r}
# adjust the axis limits, major tick positions, and axis guide
p <- p + scale_y_continuous(
  limits = c(-100, 500), 
  breaks = seq(-100, 500, 100),
  guide = "prism_offset"
)
p
```

Then we'll change the x axis limits and appearance. This step is somewhat 
complicated by 2 things:

1. We are working with log10 transformed data and want the tick marks to appear
as they do in the original plot. First we define the major ticks with the 
`breaks` and `limits` arguments. Then we use the `guide_prism_offset_minor()` 
axis guide to add minor tick marks. Finally, we use the `minor_breaks` argument 
and give it a vector that defines the x axis position of each individual minor 
tick mark.
2. We want the tick labels to be in the format **10^-7^** but at the moment they
are in the format -7. To do this we feed the `label` argument a function which 
defines a math expression will take the _number_ -7 and convert it into the
_expression_ **10^-7^**.

Very complicated and probably not necessary in real life! But in this vignette
the goal is to recreate the original plot as closely as possible.

```{r}
# adjust the axis limits, major and minor tick positions, axis guide, and 
# axis text (aka. label) appearance
p <- p + scale_x_continuous(
  limits = c(-10, -3), 
  breaks = -10:-3,
  guide = "prism_offset_minor",
  minor_breaks = log10(rep(1:9, 7)*(10^rep(-10:-4, each = 9))),
  labels = function(lab) {
    do.call(
      expression,
      lapply(paste(lab), function(x) bquote(bold("10"^.(x))))
    )
  }
)
p
```

Finally, we will fix the axis titles.

```{r, fig.width=5}
# remove the y axis title and legend title, change the x axis title and
# move the legend to the top left
p <- p + 
  theme(axis.title.y = element_blank()) + 
  labs(x = "[Agonist], M")
p
```

And that's it! Our ggplot graph is almost identical to the original.

## Plot source code

Here is the complete code for the plot (remember the order of layers is important).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dose_resp <- y ~ min + ((max - min) / (1 + exp(hill_coefficient * (ec50 - x))))

ggplot(df, aes(x = log.agonist, y = response)) + 
  geom_smooth(
    aes(colour = treatment),
    method = "nls", formula = dose_resp, se = FALSE,
    method.args = list(start = list(min = 1.67, max = 397, ec50 = -7, hill_coefficient = 1))
  ) + 
  scale_colour_manual(labels = c("No inhibitor", "Inhibitor"),
                      values = c("#00167B", "#9FA3FE")) + 
  guides(
    colour = guide_legend(position = "inside"),
    shape = guide_legend(position = "inside")     
  ) +
  theme(
    legend.title = element_blank(),
    legend.position.inside = c(0.5, 0.5),
    legend.justification = c(0.05, 0.95)
  ) +
  ggnewscale::new_scale_colour() +
  geom_point(aes(colour = treatment, shape = treatment), size = 3) + 
  scale_colour_prism(palette = "winter_bright", 
                     labels = c("No inhibitor", "Inhibitor")) + 
  scale_shape_prism(labels = c("No inhibitor", "Inhibitor")) + 
  theme_prism(palette = "winter_bright", base_size = 16) +
  theme(
    legend.title = element_blank(),
    legend.position.inside = c(0.5, 0.5),
    legend.justification = c(0.05, 0.95)
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-100, 500), 
                     breaks = seq(-100, 500, 100),
                     guide = "prism_offset") + 
  scale_x_continuous(
    limits = c(-10, -3), 
    breaks = -10:-3,
    guide = "prism_offset_minor",
    minor_breaks = log10(rep(1:9, 7)*(10^rep(-10:-4, each = 9))),
    labels = function(lab) {
      do.call(
        expression,
        lapply(paste(lab), function(x) bquote(bold("10"^.(x))))
      )
    }
  ) + 
  theme(axis.title.y = element_blank()) + 
  labs(x = "[Agonist], M")
```
