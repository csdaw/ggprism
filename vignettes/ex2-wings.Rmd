In this vignette we will recreate Figure 2B from 
[Matsushita & Nishimura (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-020-0889-1)[^source]
which was made in GraphPad Prism 7.

The authors of this paper mutate trehalose synthesis enzyme (_Tps1_) in
fruit flies and then observe the effect of this mutation on their wings. 
Figure 2B, shown below, shows the percentage change in three fly wing attributes in 
homozygous _Tps1_ mutants compared to heterozygous _Tps1_ mutants. The data are 
separated according to the sex of the fly.

![Figure 2B from Matsushita & Nishimura (2020)](figure_2B.png){ width=70% }

The raw data underlying Figure 2B is accessible in the article's Supplementary 
Data. For ease of use, this small data set (aptly named `wings`) has been 
'tidied' and is provided with the `ggprism` package. 

## Preparation

To recreate this figure 
we begin with loading the required packages and data set.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggprism)
library(ggbeeswarm)
library(rstatix)
data("wings")
```

```{r}
head(wings)
```

The data are already in 'long format' so we could just jump straight to 
plotting. However, we can see that the text in the `measure` column is not
in title case so we'll need to quickly do some string manipulation.

```{r}
# substitute period with space, convert to title case, convert back to factor
wings$measure <- wings$measure %>% 
  gsub("\\.", " ", .) %>% 
  tools::toTitleCase() %>% 
  factor(., levels = c("Wing Size", "Cell Size", "Cell Number"))
```

```{r}
head(wings)
```

## Adjusting data-related elements

Now we'll just give the `ggplot()` function our data.

```{r}
# plot the wing measurement vs the percentage change compared to
# the heterozygous mutants
p <- ggplot(wings, aes(x = measure, y = percent.change))
```

First we will plot the individual data points with random jitter using 
`geom_beeswarm()` from the [`ggbeeswarm`](https://github.com/eclarke/ggbeeswarm) 
package. We will also colour the
points and adjust their horizontal position them by genotype.

```{r}
# add the data points and fill according to the genotype
p <- p + ggbeeswarm::geom_beeswarm(
  aes(fill = genotype), 
  dodge.width = 0.9, 
  shape = 21
)
p
```

Now we want to separate the points according to sex as in the original plot.
For this we can just use `facet_wrap()` and then set the facet titles to the 
Unicode symbols for male and female.

```{r}
# separate data according to fly sex
p <- p + facet_wrap(
    ~ sex, 
    scales = "free",
    labeller = labeller(sex = c(male = "\u2642", female = "\u2640"))
  )
p
```

Overlying the points in the original plot is a horizontal dotted line at 
y = 0. This is added to our ggplot using `geom_hline()`.

```{r}
# plot a horiztonal line at y = 0 i.e. percentage change = 0
p <- p + geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = 2, size = 0.3)
p
```

On top of this are red horizontal bars showing the mean value for each group.
These can be added to ggplots using the `stat_summary()` function with the
`geom_crossbar()` Geom.

```{r}
# plot solid red lines at the mean of each group
p <- p + stat_summary(
    geom = "crossbar",
    aes(fill = genotype),
    fun = mean,
    position = position_dodge(0.9),
    colour = "red",
    size = 0.4, width = 0.7,
    show.legend = FALSE
  )
p
```

The last data-related element to be added are the p-value brackets. To do this 
we need to generate a table of p-values with the correct format, and then 
use this table with the `add_pvalue()` function from `ggprism`.

The easiest way to generate the p-value table is with the 
[`rstatix`](https://github.com/kassambara/rstatix) (you could also do it 
manually but using `rstatix` ensures the table is of the correct format).
In this case we group the `wings` data by sex and wing measure, and then test 
whether the percentage
change in wing size/cell size/cell number is explained by the fly genotype.
We also use the `add_x_position()` function from `rstatix` to make sure the
bracket ends have the correct x axis positions (specifically the `xmin` and 
`xmax` columns). Lastly, we manually change the
bracket labels to appear as we would like them to.

```{r}
# perform t-tests to compare the means of the genotypes for each measure
# and correct the p-values for multiple testing
wings_pvals <- wings %>%
  group_by(sex, measure) %>%
  rstatix::t_test(
    percent.change ~ genotype, 
    p.adjust.method = "BH", 
    var.equal = TRUE, 
    ref.group = "Tps1MIC/+"
  ) %>%
  rstatix::add_x_position(x = "measure", dodge = 0.9) %>% # dodge must match points
  mutate(label = c("***", "*", "P = 0.26", "***", "***", "P = 0.65"))

wings_pvals
```

With this p-value table, we can now add p-value brackets.

```{r}
# plot the p-values with brackets for each comparison
p <- p + add_pvalue(
    wings_pvals, y = 10, xmin = "xmin", xmax = "xmax", tip.length = 0, 
    fontface = "italic", lineend = "round", bracket.size = 0.5
  )
p
```

## Adjusting theme elements

With the data-related elements in place we can turn to changing the overall
plot theme and appearance. First, we'll apply `theme_prism()`. By default
the theme uses all bold font so we set `base_fontface = "plain"` so that
all text is of normal weight.

```{r}
# apply theme_prism()
p <- p + theme_prism(
  base_fontface = "plain", 
  base_line_size = 0.7, 
  base_family = "Arial"
)
p
```

We'll need to fix the x axes text as the labels are overlapping, and the axes
use brackets instead of a line. We can fix the labels using line breaks as in 
the original plot, and also set the axes guides to `guide_prism_bracket()`.

```{r}
# change the x axis to brackets and add line breaks to the axis text
p <- p + scale_x_discrete(
    guide = guide_prism_bracket(width = 0.15), 
    labels = scales::wrap_format(5)
  )
p
```

Now we'll fix the y axes so that they are identical as in the original Figure 2B.
We'll also apply the `guide_prism_offset()` guide so the axis line doesn't extend 
beyond the outermost tick marks. Additionally, we'll adjust the y axis title.

```{r}
# adjust the y axis limits and change the style to 'offset'
p <- p + scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(-20, 12),
    expand = c(0, 0),
    breaks = seq(-20, 10, 5),
    guide = "prism_offset"
  ) + 
  labs(y = "% change")
p
```
The plot is already looking good as is. But the goal of this vignette is to
recreate the original as closely as possible, so we will continue with some
minor adjustments. 

We need to use `scale_fill_manual()` to change the point fills to match. We'll
also fix the formatting of the legend text in this step.

```{r}
# change the point fill and adjust the legend text formatting
p <- p + scale_fill_manual(
    values = c("#026FEE", "#87FFFF"), 
    labels = c(expression("Tps"*1^italic("MIC")~"/ +"), 
               expression("Tps"*1^italic("MIC")))
  )
p
```

Next we'll do a few things at once in one call of the `theme()` function:

1. Move the legend below the plot
1. Remove the x axis title
1. Make the male and female symbols larger
1. Make the legend more compact
1. Reduce the space between the legend symbols and the legend text

```{r}
p <- p + theme(
    legend.position = "bottom",
    axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    strip.text = element_text(size = 14),
    legend.spacing.x = unit(0, "pt"),
    legend.text = element_text(margin = margin(r = 20))
  )
p
```

The original graph also has a label with the number of replicates in the 
bottom right of the plotting area. This is a little tricky to do with facets 
and requires creating a dummy data.frame to get the positioning correct.

```{r}
# add n = 10 as a text annotation
p <- p + geom_text(
    data = data.frame(
      sex = factor("female", levels = c("male", "female")), 
      measure = "Cell Number", 
      percent.change = -18.5, 
      lab = "(n = 10)"
    ), 
    aes(label = lab)
  )
p
```

The final thing to do is just make the legend symbols a bit larger using
the `overrride.aes` argument in `guide_legend()`.

```{r}
# make the points larger in the legend only
p <- p + guides(fill = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 3)))
p
```

And that's it! Our ggplot graph is almost identical to the original.
